"""Where each open window is heading: arithmetic on the readings unlimited has already taken.

A reading says how much of a window is used; it cannot say whether that is a lot for the time
elapsed. Two sources say where it is heading:

- This window's own readings give two paces extended to the reset: the average since the window
  opened (long memory), and a recency-weighted pace whose half-life is a fourteenth of the window
  (12 hours of a week, ~21 minutes of 5 hours), so a burst lifts it and a quiet spell lets it fall.
- Past windows of the same limit give the shape of use: how much each one still used from this
  point of the window to its end. That knows the night is quiet and Monday is busy, which no pace
  does. A past window that hit its limit is extended at its own pace, as demand it could not spend.

With few past windows the projection is the paces'; it moves to the past windows' as they
accumulate. `at_reset` is [low, high], unclamped: 1.07 means use would pass the limit.
`recent_at_reset` is the recent pace alone, extended to the reset: today's momentum, which
past windows do not move.
`exhausts_at` is when the high end reaches 1.0, if before the reset. `run_out` is how likely use
passes the limit, from the past windows that, shifted to today's use, did. None of it is advice.
