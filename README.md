# unlimited

How much of each AI subscription you have used, per window, and where each window is heading:
Claude, Codex, Z.ai GLM, Kimi Code, OpenCode Go, Grok, Neuralwatt and Command Code, across every account on the machine.

![The menu bar strip: one tile per account, its weekly use coloured by where it is heading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endario/unlimited/main/docs/img/strip.png)

It comes three ways, all from the same readings:

- **In the menu bar**: a macOS app, one tile per account.
- **In the terminal**: `unlimited`, a block per account.
- **For agents**: `unlimited read --json`, for load-balancing and pacing work across subscriptions.

```
uv tool install unlimited                # or: pipx install unlimited
```

```
unlimited                                # usage per account, for people
unlimited read [--vendor V]... [--max-age SECONDS] --json
unlimited capture claude-statusline      # in a Claude Code statusline script
unlimited COMMAND --help
```

Each reading gives each limit's window length, the fraction used so far, and its reset time. It
also gives whether the vendor says the limit is held, and why, and, where the vendor names it,
the account's plan and, for Claude, its credits: what it may spend once the windows are used.
unlimited reports what the vendor says, and projects it forward: a reading never
picks an account or draws a threshold. Choosing what to do with a reading is up to the consumer.

## In the menu bar

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endario/unlimited/main/docs/img/popover.png" width="346" align="right" alt="The popover for one account: a card per window, with its bar, pace and forecast">

Each tile shows an account's weekly use. When another of its windows is in worse shape, the tile
cross-fades to it now and then. The thin bar beside each figure is how much of the week has
passed. Where a vendor has several accounts, the one to use next is underlined.

The colour says where the window is heading, once there is enough to go on:

- **Blue**: it resets soon with room to spare. Spend it.
- **Green**: it is heading well under the limit.
- **Plain**: carry on.
- **Amber**: it might run out before it resets.
- **Red**: it will, or it has.

Click a tile for its account's windows. On each bar, the line is where an even pace would be by
now, ▼ is where today's pace reaches by the reset and ▲ is the forecast. Below it: 🔥 when it
runs out, 🎲 the chance it does, ↻ when it resets and 📈 the forecast. A forecast in a thinner
weight rests on this window alone, before past windows back it. Click another tile to switch
accounts. Settings relabels, hides and reorders tiles.

The app reads no credential and calls no vendor: it runs `unlimited read --json`. To build it,
with Command Line Tools only:

```
cd macos && make app && open .build/Unlimited.app
```

## In the terminal

## For agents

`unlimited read --json` gives the same readings, one per account (one limit shown):

    ]
  }
]
```

Read `projection.at_reset` against `used_at_least` rather than either alone, and
`past_windows`/`samples` for how much the projection rests on.

`role` says what kind of window a limit is, whatever the vendor calls it: `session`, `weekly`,
`weekly_model` (one model's weekly limit, named in `scope`), `month`, `extra` (any other window,
named in `scope` where the vendor names it), or `null` for an entry that repeats another or is not
a window. `names` are this machine's names for the account: the config directories or wrappers
holding its credential.

## Models

`unlimited models [--tier T] [--json]` lists what each provider offers at a tier, promotions
first; `--provider P` prints one model id; `--catalog` prints the whole merged catalog as JSON. The list ships in
[`catalog.toml`](src/unlimited/catalog.toml). `~/.config/unlimited/catalog.toml` overrides it on one
machine, with no release. Format and merge rules: [docs/catalog.md](docs/catalog.md).

`unlimited off TARGET [--for 90m|12h|1d|1w] [--why TEXT]` switches a provider (`stealth`), a model, a vendor (by its
usage name, also one with no catalog route here — its accounts then stop being `verdict`'s to offer), an offering
id, or a `provider:model` pair off on this machine, until `unlimited on TARGET` or the `--for` time
passes; `--account NAME` narrows a vendor switch to one account (its id or an identity name like
`claude-glm-2`, matched only by `verdict` — the vendor's routes and other accounts stay offerable;
a name no account here answers to is accepted and simply matches nothing).
`unlimited off` lists what is off, `unlimited off --json` as a JSON array. A target with a catalog
route drops out of `models` and `--catalog` like a ban; a route-less vendor binds `verdict` alone. The switches live in
`~/.config/unlimited/switches.json`.

## Outcomes

Which model to use for a task, and a record of how each use went, so the next choice learns from it:

```
unlimited choose --tier standard --candidates codex,glm,deepseek --deadline 900 --json > decision.json
# launch candidates[pick].model; if it cannot run, the next index in order
id=$(unlimited attempt start --provider P --model M --deadline 900 --decision "$(jq -r .decision decision.json)")
unlimited attempt end "$id" --outcome ok --tokens-in N --tokens-out N
```

`choose` orders the candidates (providers, models or offering ids) by expected minutes: how often
each fails here, how long it takes, and what its quota costs (`--quota ID=ρ`, the account's
projected use at reset). It explores by itself, trying a route with a thin
record about as often as it could be the best, so there is nothing to tune; `--exclude`,
`--prefer`, `--vendors`, `--temperature` and `--quota-weight` are there for the rare caller that
needs them. A start whose deadline passes with no end counts as a timeout. Task labels and
`--meta` are the caller's, recorded and never read. `unlimited outcomes` shows each route's recent
record; everything lands in `~/.local/state/unlimited/decisions.jsonl`. Each command's options:
`unlimited COMMAND --help`.

`unlimited cards [--tier T] [--json]` shows each route's model card: what its vendor publishes
(intelligence, tokens per second, price per million tokens; the catalog's `[[cards]]`) beside what
its runs here show (failure rate, durations, tokens, pace over the whole run, and the cost of a
typical run at the card's price). Price and speed belong to the vendor, not the model: a route whose
own vendor has no card shows another vendor's as a guideline only. Design:
[docs/choice.md](docs/choice.md).

## Verdicts

`unlimited verdict --work SECONDS [--model-scope M] [--max-age S] [--vendor V]... --json` says, for
each account, whether it can take a unit of work of that length on that model family: `unread`,
`excluded` (with the window that binds and when it lifts; or, for a vendor switched off here, when
the switch lifts), or `ranked` (with a tier and a score). Advisory: it reserves nothing. Design:
[docs/choice.md](docs/choice.md).

## Credits

A window at 100% is not always the end. Where the vendor reports it (Claude's `spend`), the reading's
`credits` says what the account may spend past its windows, in `currency`'s major units:
`used` of `limit` this period, any prepaid `balance`, and whether spending is `enabled` now, with
the vendor's own `disabled_reason` when it is not (e.g. `org_level_disabled_until`, a cap the
organisation switched off). `limit: null` with `enabled: false` is an account that never turned
credits on. Whether more can be spent is `enabled` and `used < limit`; unlimited draws no line.
`credits.taken_at` is when the vendor said so: a fresh statusline `capture` carries the last
API read's credits forward, dated. `credits` is `null` for vendors without the concept, and is
not projected: the vendor reports no reset for it.

## Sources

| Vendor | Local, no network | Network |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic (Claude Code, claude.ai sign-in) | the `rate_limits` Claude Code hands its statusline, via `capture` | `oauth/usage` on Claude Code's own token |
| OpenAI (Codex, ChatGPT sign-in) | `rate_limits` in Codex's session logs | `wham/usage` on Codex's own token |
| Z.ai (GLM coding plan) | — | `quota/limit` on each claude-glm wrapper's API key |
| Moonshot Kimi (Kimi Code coding plan) | — | `coding/v1/usages` on each claude-kimi wrapper's API key |
| OpenCode Go | — | `zen/go/v1/usage` on the Go key in each opencode identity's auth.json: the default and every `~/.opencode-N` ([add another](scripts/add-opencode-go-account.sh)) |
| xAI Grok (SuperGrok, Grok CLI sign-in) | — | the Grok CLI's billing proxy on its own token |
| Neuralwatt Cloud | — | `v1/quota` on `$NEURALWATT_API_KEY` and each `~/.config/neuralwatt*.env` |
| Command Code | — | `alpha/billing/credits` and `alpha/billing/subscriptions` on `$COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY` and each `~/.config/commandcode*.env` |

The network endpoints are not officially documented and may change without notice. unlimited
reads each tool's credential where the tool keeps it and never writes it back. The one token
it refreshes is Grok's, whose sign-in lasts hours: the renewed token is kept, owner-only, in
`~/.cache/unlimited/credentials/`. No token appears in its output, readings or errors.

## Projection

Each limit also carries a `projection`: where the window is heading, from the readings unlimited
has taken. Within the window, two paces are extended to the reset — the average since it opened,
and a recency-weighted pace with a half-life of a fourteenth of the window, which rises with a
burst and falls in a quiet spell. Past windows of the same limit, kept for
eight windows, add the shape of use (quiet nights, busy Mondays): each one's use from this point
to its end, shifted to today's. They take over from the paces between the third and eighth window.

`at_reset` is `[low, high]`, unclamped, so `1.07` means use would pass the limit. `recent_at_reset` is the recent pace alone
extended to the reset: today's momentum, which past windows do not move. `exhausts_at`
is when the high end reaches it, if before the reset. `run_out` is how likely use passes it, from the past windows that did, or `null`
without them. `samples`, `past_windows` and `since` say what it rests on. A projection is only as good as how often something reads: a statusline
`capture` feeds it continuously.

## Cache

There is one cache file and one `flock` per vendor under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/unlimited`, mode
`0600`. Concurrent callers share one upstream request. A 429's `Retry-After` holds off every
caller until it passes, capped at 24 hours; a 429 or 5xx holds off at least five minutes, and the
account's last good reading stands in the meantime. On macOS the keychain is readable only from the
user's GUI session or launchd, not over plain ssh.

## Status

Pre-release. The schema (`"schema": 1`) may still change.

## Releasing

`main` takes changes only through a pull request that passes the tests and the identity check.
The tests are stdlib `unittest`; from the repo root:
`PYTHONPATH=src:tests python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (the macOS app's: `cd macos && make test`).
Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` in one, merge it, then tag the merge commit `vX.Y.Z` and push
the tag: the Publish workflow puts it on PyPI by trusted publishing, with no stored token.

## 2mw2lt

unlimited was built alongside [2mw2lt](https://2mw2lt.com) — *Too Much Work, Too Little Time* — a
steering partner that coordinates work across AI workers and trusted people, which reads its
accounts through unlimited. unlimited knows nothing of 2mw2lt and is meant to be useful on its own. Its sibling
[work-tempo](https://github.com/endario/work-tempo) tracks source-code momentum across Git workspaces.
